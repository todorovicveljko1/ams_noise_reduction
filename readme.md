## Introduction

## Ideas

- Use mask so we only select patches inside lungs
- Noise used: 
    - poisson
    - gaussian
    - peper and salt.
- Models:
    - autoencoder

## Questions
- Is the noise distribution is different on different parts of the tissue?
- Do we need to use small amount of corctive noise (-noise)
